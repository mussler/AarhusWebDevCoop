        <articleTitle><![CDATA[Ring of lies: The wildest wrestling conspiracy theories]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>Professional wrestling is an art form based on deception. The musclebound lummoxes in the ring are using intricate choreography and years of training to look like they’re actually fighting, but the outcome is predetermined and they probably carpool after the show. Most fans know and accept this, but being forced to walk the line between truth and fiction can bring you to some pretty interesting places.</p>
<p>Wrestling fans know they’re being lied to, and accept it, but that doesn’t keep them from trying to find out the truth behind the lies. A whole economy of dirt sheets and gossip sites has sprung up to document what happens behind the veil of “kayfabe” — the carny term for the business. That gives fans a little bit of information, and as we all know a little bit of information can be a dangerous thing. From real fights that were actually faked to fake fights that were all too real and everything in between, consider this the <em>X-Files</em> of wrestling.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648257" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/roman-reigns-625x351.jpg" alt="Triple H and Roman Reigns" width="625" height="351" /></p>
<h3>The political hit on Roman Reigns</h3>
<p>Let’s open this up with the conspiracy theory currently sweeping the blogosphere: that WWE, despite appearances, doesn’t want Roman Reigns to succeed as its top babyface. It seems counterintuitive at first glance. Why would the company invest TV time into Reigns if not to make him popular? But the theory, as first advanced by long-time fan Dylan Hales, seems more and more feasible every day. Despite his charisma and ability, fans haven’t taken to Reigns because of the way the company seemingly unrelentingly pushes him, whether it’s making him deliver mind-bogglingly unfunny promos about “tater tots” or winning matches over more popular opponents.</p>
<p>After Triple H won the title at the Royal Rumble, he started getting more cheers than Reigns, despite his role as a villain. Was that his plan all along? He is the future owner of the company, after all.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648259" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ultimate-warrior-625x313.jpg" alt="Ultimate Warrior" width="625" height="313" /></p>
<h3>Ultimate Warrior died and was replaced</h3>
<p>Jim Hellwig, the man better known as the Ultimate Warrior, is one of the most fascinating figures in pro wrestling history. His insane energy and almost nonexistent in-ring talent made him an icon of the 1980s second only to Hulk Hogan. In 1991, Hellwig demanded more money and the company cut him loose without explaining anything to the fans. He returned at WrestleMania the next year, but something about him was different. His physique was less impressive, his ring gear changed, and his wrestling skills somehow even worse. Some fans started theorizing that the Warrior was seriously not the same man, that Jim Hellwig died and the company just found a new guy to fill his boots.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time WWE would pull a stunt like that, and it wouldn’t be the last. Alas, the conspiracy was false and it was just the same old guy, who eventually died for real in 2014.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648260" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vince-russo-625x345.jpg" alt="Vince Russo" width="625" height="345" /></p>
<h3>Vince Russo was a plant</h3>
<p>When we talk controversial figures in wrestling, the name Vince Russo always comes up. The writer was one of the major architects of the Attitude Era in the WWE, where the company found incredible success by pushing the envelope of good taste and capturing the robust nu-metal zeitgeist. When his ideas got too stupid for the promotion, they sent him packing and he went to competitor WCW. While there, he proceeded to basically run the company into the ground with bad decision after bad decision. One example: he booked both David Arquette and himself into holding the company’s most prestigious title.</p>
<p>Some people, including wrestler Bill Goldberg, believe that Russo did all this damage at the behest of Vince McMahon, who let him go specifically to sink the competition. Russo was later hired by TNA, where he did the exact same thing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648255" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/montreal-screwjob-625x352.jpg" alt="Montreal Screwjob" width="625" height="352" /></p>
<h3>The Montreal Screwjob was a work</h3>
<p>One of the most famous moments in wrestling history happened at the 1997 Survivor Series pay-per-view. Canadian hometown hero Bret Hart was scheduled to defend his title against the cocky Shawn Michaels in the Molson Centre. The plan for the match was for it to end in disqualification when other wrestlers interfered, because Hart was about to leave the company but didn’t want to lose the belt in Canada to the villainous Michaels. The match went as planned until the closing moments, when Michaels put Hart in the Sharpshooter (his own finishing move) and the referee called for the bell, claiming Hart had submitted and lost the match. Hart was enraged, spitting in Vince McMahon’s face and knocking him out with a legit punch.</p>
<p>It’s a famous tale, but a group of fans and even some wrestlers firmly believe that it’s all a lie: Hart, always the showman, must have been in on it all along.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648252" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bruiser-brody-625x351.jpg" alt="Bruiser Brody" width="625" height="351" /></p>
<h3>The murder of Bruiser Brody</h3>
<p>Puerto Rico was a popular destination for wrestlers in the ’70s and ’80s. The island loved pro grappling, and bouts could get bloody and sweaty. In 1988, Bruiser Brody, a legendary wrestler who worked all over the world, was stabbed to death in the locker room of the Juan Lobriel Stadium in Baymon by another wrestler, Jose Gonzales. Despite dozens of witnesses backstage seeing Gonzales going into the back with Brody and being the last person to see him alive, nobody would testify against him in court. The few American wrestlers there gave statements, but were never called to testify.</p>
<p>Was this conspiracy of silence a way to keep the code of honor between fake fighters, even at the expense of Brody’s life? It’s a question that may never be answered.</p>

<h3>Steven Regal got fired for embarrassing Goldberg</h3>
<p>In 1998, WCW had almost all of their eggs in one basket: a former football player named Bill Goldberg who the company booked on a massive undefeated streak, easily plowing through every wrestler in his way. But when he faced British legend Steven Regal on WCW’s flagship program Nitro, things turned out a little differently. Regal, always the veteran, tried to take Goldberg through some more complex sequences of holds, but the rookie couldn’t keep up and things looked unusually “real” for a bunch of the match. This wouldn’t normally be a big deal, but Regal was fired from the company the very same night. Fans put two and two together and postulated that, for embarrassing the company’s new star, WCW cut Regal loose.</p>
<div class="row collapse"></div>
<p>The truth is less interesting: he was fired for his substance abuse problem.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648256" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/randy-savage-1-625x351.jpg" alt="Randy Macho Man Savage" width="625" height="351" /></p>
<h3>Why Randy Savage will never be in the Hall of Fame</h3>
<p>The WWE Hall of Fame is one of the most hallowed groups of grapplers on Earth, with nearly every great competitor (and Donald Trump, for some reason) enshrined in it. If you look through the rolls, though, you’ll notice one very famous name missing: Macho Man Randy Savage. All of Savage’s peers are present, but the high-flying Slim Jim spokesman isn’t in the Hall, and according to some fans will never be.</p>
<p>Why? The prevailing theory is that Savage had screwed around sexually with Stephanie McMahon before she was of legal age, and when Vince found out he blew his top and refused to ever do business with him again. There’s no evidence of this, and it’s probably more likely that Vince hates Savage for leaving for WCW, but plenty of other Hall of Famers did that.</p>

<h3>WWE is full of Satanic Illuminati rituals</h3>
<p>The rise of “the Illuminati,” that shadowy organization that controls the world, is ripe ground for conspiracy theorists. Wrestling is no exception — there are reams of YouTube videos where people analyze fake fighting to ferret out the hidden symbolism that allegedly transmits mind control concepts to our brains.</p>
<p>WrestleMania 31 was apparently an occult ritual designed to increase Satan’s hold on our souls, and the proof is all of the triangles. Speaking of triangles, tag team the Ascension are popular wrestlers in the conspiracyverse for their eye-in-the-pyramid logo. Why exactly they’d use the Illuminati symbol on guys who get their asses kicked all the time is anybody’s guess.</p>

<h3>The Shockmaster was set up to fail</h3>
<p>From the ridiculous to the even more ridiculous. The debut of The Shockmaster in 1993 (really Fred “Tugboat” Ottman in a spray-painted Stormtrooper mask) is one of the biggest fails in wrestling history.</p>
<p>Intended to make a dramatic entrance bursting through a wall, Ottman instead tripped coming through and fell on his generous belly, losing his helmet in the process. What was supposed to be the debut of a new fan favorite turned Ottman into a laughingstock. It seemed like an accident, but some wrestling fans believe that WCW exec David Crockett, who hated the Shockmaster gimmick, actually added a piece of lumber to the bottom of the wall so it wouldn’t break appropriately and sabotage the debut.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648261" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vince-shawn-625x391.jpg" alt="Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels" width="625" height="391" /></p>
<h3>Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels were lovers</h3>
<p>We touched on the Montreal Screwjob above, but the career of Shawn Michaels certainly has some odd moments. His continued push and ability to get away with things that would get other wrestlers fired had many fans postulating that there was something going on between him and Vince McMahon. Why would McMahon — who is widely known to prefer huge, beefy dudes working for him — give the lithe Heartbreak Kid so much exposure? Why would he pay Shawn’s full salary for four years while he was out of the ring?</p>
<p>One conspiracy theory is that the duo were lovers and had been getting it on for years. Several grapplers, including Road Warrior Hawk, have stated this as if it were a fact, but it seems pretty unlikely.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1648253" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chris-benoit-625x351.jpg" alt="Chris Benoit" width="625" height="351" /></p>
<h3>Kevin Sullivan killed Chris Benoit</h3>
<p>Let’s close this one out with a conspiracy theory about one of the most tragic moments in wrestling history. In 2007, wrestler Chris Benoit killed his wife and son before hanging himself, a decision at least partially blamed on brain damage from the multitude of concussions he’d taken during his career. But some fans believe that Benoit is innocent, and the real killer is another wrestler. See, Benoit’s wife Nancy used to be married to Kevin Sullivan, who actually booked an angle where she would cheat on him with Benoit that turned into a real-life relationship.</p>
<p>Sullivan, who is certainly a shady character, is theorized to have never gotten over the snub and hired hitmen to rub out Benoit and his family. It’s unlikely, sure, but there are definitely fans who believe it.</p>
<p>Wrestling can not only be the most exciting, shocking thing on television at times, but it’s also perfect for falling down Wikipedia holes during the wee hours of the night.</p>]]></articleContent>

        <articleTitle><![CDATA[5 Inappropriate CAPTCHA's]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>Most people have a love-hate relationship with the <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/tagged/captcha" target="_blank">CAPTCHA</a>. We love them because they keep people from spamming our sites (for the most part), but sometimes the make our eyes hurt and frustrate us as we try to figure out what exactly the garbled words say. Sometimes, you can’t even make them out and have try, time and again, to prove that you are human.</p>
<p>Today it might seem hard to remember what life was like before CAPTCHAs started being used by AltaVista and Yahoo in 2000. Back then, CAPTCHAs were designed to prevent automated chat bots and URL submissions. Despite their popularity today not many people know that CAPTCHA isn’t just a something that sounds cool (and kind of like “gotcha”). It’s actually is an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turning test to tell Computer and Humans Apart”.</p>
<p>Here is something even more interesting than acronyms (yes, such a thing exists). With the billions of CAPTCHAs being jumbled around the web, you’re more than likely to come across one that’s either inappropriate, laugh-out-loud hilarious, or just down right confusing. We’ve compiled a list of the craziest ones we could find. Read on, and be thankful that your email wasn’t stuck behind one of these.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/captcha-facebook-captcha-fail.jpg" alt="" title="captcha facebook-captcha-fail" width="500" height="259" /></p>
<p>Facebook is always trying to assure us that it’s tough about it’s security, but maybe it’s being a little too tough with this CAPTCHA.<em> (via <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/08/04/facebook-captcha-fail/" target="_blank">Sophos</a>)</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1421703" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Picture-8-580x239.png" alt="" title="Picture 8" width="580" height="239" /></p>
<p>The other day I was trying to post something for sale on Craigslist but could not get past the CAPTCHA on the final page. I just couldn’t unscramble it for the life of me. I had to click the refresh button three times before I stopped in my tracks to see a CAPTCHA in Hebrew. I suppose, not matching the alphabet of the site you are using is one way to thwart bots.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1421707" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/captcha-white-house.jpg" alt="" title="captcha white house" width="500" height="205" /></p>
<div class="row collapse"></div>
<p>We move from religious profiling to the White House with the next CAPTCHA. The official White House website <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-cetera/white-house-captcha-accidentally-endorses-treason-20101014/" target="_blank">unfortunately pictured the above CAPTCHA</a> which one Cisco engineer found while trying to send President Obama a message. A CAPTCHA creator explained that they do “heavy filtering to prevent offensive combinations,” but sometimes “things slip through.” This caption goes right from confusion to treason.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1421743 alignnone" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/captcha-Disqus-e1324325170436.jpg" alt="captcha Disqus - boing" title="captcha Disqus - boing" width="451" height="268" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/08/22/a-gallery-of-indecipherable-captchas.html" target="_blank">BoingBoing</a> reader’s patience was put to the test when he tried to post using the site’s DISQUS commenting system (the same one we use on Geek.com). The result was a slew of incredibly indecipherable CAPTCHAs. How many normal keyboards out there have a lambda key?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1421749" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/captcha-3-MCs-468x440.png" alt="" title="captcha 3 MCs" width="468" height="440" /></p>
<p>Beastie Boys fans may be wondering why exactly this CAPTCHA didn’t work. The computer is telling the user that it’s incorrect, but clearly, there is no better answer than the one provided. Perhaps Mix Master Mike can figure it out what went wrong?</p>]]></articleContent>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p><strong>NASA</strong>’s history is necessarily wacky, checkered, and filled with secrecy. Throughout its life NASA has been involuntarily inserted into issues of national security and national fervor, forced to deal with all sorts of non-scientific priorities that confound their high-minded exploratory mindset. Not only that, the agency was pioneering a whole new form of science and planning to put people into conditions no human had ever experienced before.</p>
<p>Their ignorance, combined with neurotic double-checking, has led to some moments that seem, uh… <em>optically difficult</em>. Other times, they’re just straight up weird — but try not to judge too hard. These guys were putting humans in <a href="http://www.geek.com/tag/space/">space</a>literally before we knew where space <em>began</em>. They can be forgiven a bit of eccentricity.</p>
<p class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PnsFFhKqXXo?wmode=transparent" width="590" height="443" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>The Shake Test</h3>
<p>As mentioned, it’s easy to look back at certain past actions and scoff – but this was a legitimate test at the time. While today we think of <a href="http://www.geek.com/tag/nasa/">NASA</a> tests as going on in meticulously controlled wind tunnels and vacuum chambers, early Apollo program technology was so experimental they needed to test its basic physical properties. Forget complex ideas like ablation and heat damage — could these new-fangled space ships withstand the <em>physical</em> tortures of a launch to space?</p>
<p>Just the violent shaking of the wind was enough to scare early NASA engineers, and so they created the shake test: get a bunch of guys, grab your thing, and shake it around. If something falls off, fix it so it doesn’t happen anymore. That might sound silly, but it worked. In the test shown above, a Saturn V rocket lost its escape tower, and while I might not know what that does I do know you don’t want it falling off. Good job, shake test!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NASA-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1600469" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NASA-2-590x330.jpg" alt="NASA 2" width="590" height="330" /></a></p>
<h3>Gold foil</h3>
<p>NASA too-often comes under attack from not being frugal enough. With so many driven, brilliant individuals, so few of whom are overly concerned with feathering their nests, the nation’s space agency is actually one of its most frugal institutions. Sure, it spends a lot of money — but it has to. There’s no better example of this than gold foil, and NASA’s extensive use of it.</p>
<p>Gold, while expensive and almost comically opulent for industrial use, has a ton of useful characteristics. It has a high heat capacity so it works for shielding, and reflects a lot of the remaining light for extra protection. It’s dense enough to stop some higher-energy particles, and perfectly conducting for electronics work. Gold won’t tarnish or oxidize, and along with its physical malleability this makes it much easier (and cheaper) to work with while still inside Earth’s atmosphere. In all, gold foil may <em>seem</em> unnecessary, but it’s a quirky tool that’s absolutely vital to NASA’s overall goals.</p>

<h3>Animals in zero gravity</h3>
<p>Take a look at the header image on this article, which shows an astronaut walking suspended against a tilted wall — though his blood distribution and natural sense of direction are out of whack, this tester <em>is</em> experiencing about a Moon’s worth of pull straight down onto his feet. There’s no video available, but reports say that humans are in general less than spectacular at figuring out how to walk in low gravity. Thus, NASA has spent many years running animal behavioral experiments involving low- or zero-g — maybe some animal just happens to already have a well-evolved way of dealing with low gravity? Unfortunately for the astronauts (and the animals) they really don’t.</p>
<p>NASA has sent up frogs, birds, mammals, insects, fish, and everything in-between. Had funding been infinite, I’m sure they would have eventually tried a platypus. None of them managed very well, no matter how many tries they got and, interestingly, the more evolved for flight on Earth they were the worse they seemed to be at figuring out zero gravity. Most of these tests were conducted on parabolic flights, though, so the weightlessness only lasted about 90 seconds at most.</p>
<div id="attachment_1600471" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1600471" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-5-590x442.jpg" alt="Generals don't usually stand so close to NASA execs these days..." width="590" height="442" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Generals don’t usually stand quite so close to NASA execs these days…</p>
</div>
<h3>NASA and the military</h3>
<p>Many people don’t know it, but as the US was just starting to push into future-tech as a means to global dominance many politicians looked to NASA as a source of military and strategic power. It may seem idiotic to put a scientific organization in that position, but that’s the point — NASA wasn’t always a scientific organization. In its early days, ARPA (now DARPA) actually had to struggle with NASA, who eventually took all of their aviation projects (many were later given back for security reasons).</p>
<p>The military wanted NASA to develop rockets for delivering bombs, not astronauts, and the agency was for a time quite happy to oblige; if there’s one thing soldiers know, it’s how to get and <em>stay</em> funded. NASA was actually a fairly relevant political entity, even outside the inflated context of the space race, and there was a time when we did not draw such a hard distinction between scientific and political space projects. Partially because their skills are no longer quite so specialized, and partly because it’s difficult to deal with scientists in the context of national security, NASA quickly became a nerd haven. Its most security- and economy-focused projects went to DARPA, the NSA, and elsewhere — and thus, post Cold War, its funding stagnated. That pretty much brings us up to date.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1600476" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-3-590x399.jpg" alt="nasa 3" width="590" height="399" /></a></p>
<h3>The space pen never happened</h3>
<p>This is a pet peeve of mine. That famous space pen, the one that cost NASA millions while the Soviets worked happily with pencils? Come on. This is <em>NASA</em>; they don’t need to spend millions to make a pen that writes upside down. More to the point, there <em>is</em> a reason to use pens in space as opposed to pencils, and that reason is zero gravity; in the super-recycled environments of space vessels, assisted by zero gravity, dust from a “lead” pencil will migrate into the air filtration system and gum up the works. It could even cause negative effects for astronauts who breathe it in —  though that’s not confirmed so far as I know. All I do know is that you won’t find too many Russian cosmonauts using pencils — nor Chinese taikonauts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1600477" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-4.jpg" alt="nasa 4" width="590" height="388" /></a></p>
<h3>NASA pays people to do nothing</h3>
<p>Of all the criticisms you could level at your average astronaut, laziness is not one of them. Most of these people have PhDs, often impeccable records as fighter pilots or researchers, and they’re all in top physical condition. Even so, the confines of space are, were, and are going to be, very restrictive. Just as with the animal gravity tests, it’s necessary for NASA to look into the physical effects of that inactivity if they’re going to send people all the way to Mars and — presumably — back. That’s why NASA has, and from time to time still does, pay people to sit around doing nothing. Literally — <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will pay select applicants something like $9,000 per month to lay in bed, and not get out. For up to 70 days, participants will spend every moment laying down. Now, NASA could just look at hospital-bound patients for much of this data, but the point is to use healthy people who voluntarily avoid exercise, either by staying in bed or going to space. Keeping these participants healthy is priority number one — and as they learn how to do that more effectively, they also learn how to get healthy astronauts to the Red Planet and beyond.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1600478" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-6-590x331.jpg" alt="nasa 6" width="590" height="331" /></a></p>
<h3>NASA is actually designing a warp drive</h3>
<p>It might sound crazy, but NASA does actually have a team of wild-haired geniuses working on sci-fi inspired ideas that seem at once at odds with a hard scientific institution. A <a href="http://www.geek.com/tag/warp-drive/">warp drive</a>? The Innovative Advanced Concepts lab has taken a serious, physicist’s look at the issue, looking at the actual feasibility of bending space-time to go faster than light. That’s right — though light may be totally unbeatable in terms of speed through space, we might be able to get around that by actually adjusting the amount of space through which we must travel.</p>
<p>A proposed warp drive actually “works” by creating a space-time expansion behind the ship and a compression in front of it, essentially carrying the ship forward on a wave made of space-time. Sure, it would take virtually unthinkable amounts of energy to actually do it — but that’s the sort of linear problem we’re good at fixing. They went so far as to mock up some CG renders of what such a ship might actually look like. The above image is supplemented by a host of<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/123021064@N05/sets/72157644113972600/">other closeup renders</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1600479" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nasa-7-590x331.jpg" alt="nasa 7" width="590" height="331" /></a></p>
<p>NASA has a long history and, by virtue of its mission to look and move into the deepest possible unknowns, a quirky one as well. It’s been staffed by some of the most brilliant and troubled figures in American history, and pushed humanity through many of its most enduring obstacles.</p>
<p>It’s not just forgivable that the agency has a checkered past — it’s a fundamental and necessary part of its lofty goals. Asking NASA to be less weird would be to ask it to aim lower, and think more firmly within the box. That’s the last thing we want to do right now.</p>]]></articleContent>

<p>Here is Today was created by designer <a href="http://whitevinyldesign.com/" target="_blank" class="hawk-link-parsed">Luke Twyman</a>. He explains the motive behind the site: "Being fascinated by the scale of time, I wanted to create something that would clearly give people a sense of that vastness, and a feeling of where we sit in relation to all that's gone before. To do this, two important features on the technical side would be some kind of zooming/scaling mechanic, and also a super clean layout."</p>
<p>Twyman kept all widths relative to make the site's message convey equally well on a smaller screen: "From the start I decided to do away with pixel measurements and pt sizes for type, and instead set my own measurement unit based on a fraction of the screen width. I set one unit to be 1/22 of the screen width and positioned and scaled everything using that unit, so the spacious layout would be maintained on different displays."</p>
<p>It took just a small amount of JavaScript to put the animation in place: "The zoom mechanic is based on a simple tween animation formula, which I've used numerous times now, although I'd never used it in JS before. In fact this is only the second thing I've built using JS, but I've found the transition from other languages I've used or tried to be fairly easy, and there's plenty of great documentation at hand online."</p>]]></projectContent>

<p>Multeor is a multiplayer web game developed by Arjen de Vries and Filidor Wiese and designed by Arthur van 't Hoog. The idea of the game is to control a meteor crashing into earth. You score points by ensuring you leave the biggest trail of destruction. Up to eight players can connect to a single game simultaneously.</p>
<p>Multeor is written in plain JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas and backed with a <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" class="hawk-link-parsed">Node.js</a> server to manage the communications between the desktop and mobile devices using <a href="http://netm.ag/sockets-246" target="_blank" class="hawk-link-parsed">WebSockets</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than using one of the many game libraries, Wiese built entirely from stratch. "We decided not to use a prefab game engine," he says, "which means rendering the graphics, detecting collisions, keeping track of entities and coding a particle system for the explosions. Not depending on a specific game engine was great fun: it gave us a lot of creative freedom and we definitely learned a lot because of it."</p>]]></projectContent>

<p>Longform storytelling has been steadily gaining popularity on news and media sites, but broadcasting network <a href="http://sbs.com.au/" class="hawk-link-parsed">SBS</a>'s The Boat, an online graphic novel based on a story by Nam Le, feels unique in both its style and execution. Sumi ink illustrations, expertly executed animations and a chilling soundscape capture the story of a young Vietnamese refugee's journey.</p>
<p>To bring the story to life, illustrator Matty Huynh spent six months with Nam Le's original prose, sketching thumbnails and iteratively creating the characters.</p>
<p>"I think the balance you see comes from this extended period of development," explains producer Kylie Boltin. "That deep inward-looking period enabled the core team members to know the story inside out. We knew the story beats and we knew which moments needed to be highlighted. The guiding principle was to complement the core storytelling, rather than overpower it or add an element just for the sake of it."</p>
<p>The graphic panels feel like diary sketches – urgent, imperfect and deeply emotional. This site proves just how powerful and engaging online storytelling can be in the right hands.</p>]]></projectContent>

<p>Idea:</p>
<p>MapsTD is a tower defence game, but with a difference. You tell it where your home is, and through the power of Google Maps, it will produce a game in which you're defending your hometown, with the baddies relentlessly charging past the streets and houses of your neighbourhood.</p>
<p>This is how it works. "It's obviously built using the Google Maps API, with MooTools being used for the other aspects of the UI and as a general-purpose JavaScript library. It uses several bits of functionality provided by Google Maps. As well as the map itself, the biggest part is the route finder API, which is used to work out the paths the enemies follow. Once you've picked a start location, it does a lookup to get the latitude and longitude. It then looks for four routes by adding or subtracting a fixed number from that latitude and longitude (to get a point due north, due east, and so on), and uses Google to find a path between the two."</p>]]></projectContent>

        <projectContent><![CDATA[<p>The Peanut Gallery is a Chrome experiment that lets users add intertitles to silent film clips by talking to their browser," he says.</p>
<p>"The technology behind it is Google's Web Speech API, a JavaScript API that lets developers integrate speech recognition into their web apps." The project does a good job of demonstrating the Web Speech API, which displays live text updates as it tries to understand a human's speech.</p>
<p>"One of our favourite features of the API is that text updates in real time while you speak," Klump continues. "For example, if you say 'European Union' slowly, you can watch as the API begins by printing 'your' or 'year' and then corrects it to 'European Union'. "Another neat feature (for English speakers only at this point), is punctuation. Say 'question mark', 'exclamation point', 'comma', or 'period' and the API will insert the correct punctuation for you," adds Klump.</p>]]></projectContent>
